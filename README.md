# Learning Elixir - Tests First
This is just the journey I'm taking. Your path may vary. What matters is that your learning, and that you're having fun :)

# Why Elixir? 
I think I should start here. There are a number of other languages out there. I've dated quite a few of them. While exhausting at times, I think dating all of these languages gives me a different view of programming. Each language has it's own nuiances. They each have their own communities and eco-systems.  

These things make me think. Sometimes they make me think hard. That's when things REALLY get interesting.  

In college, I had a professor who made us speak our math. It was a linear algebra course. He didn't let us get by just solving the equations and moving on to the next problem. He wanted more from us. He had us talk about Kernels, Eigenvectors, Linear Transformations, Dot-Products, and so on - things which had abstract symbols that we could manipulate on paper but didn't quite grok at times. He required that each of us articulate what we were doing in plain ol' English. It was hard. He made us think more deeply than others' had asked us to about what we were doing. I enjoyed that.  

He was an interesting professor. I remember him telling us how important communication was. If my memory is right, he was Hungarian and in addition to speaking Hungarian fluently, had a strong grasp of several other languages as well.  

Some of his philosphy and teachings heavily influenced my views on communication: If I didn't have the word for a feeling or a thought, I would stuggle to communicate it to others - and even to understand it myself. My feedback loops would have impedements based on these limitations. 

I see this with my children. Their vocabulary is growing, but sometimes they become frustrated when they can't communicate their wants or how they're feeling (they're 4 and 1). I still feel this sometimes when I'm unsure how to communicate what I'm thinking or feeling and have to slow down, collect my thoughts, maybe draw things out, or find some mechanism to sort it all out and make sense of it.
