# Learning Elixir - Tests First
This is just the journey I'm taking. Your path may vary. What matters is that your learning, and that you're having fun :)

# Why Elixir? 
I think I should start here. There are a number of other languages out there. I've dated quite a few of them. While exhausting at times, I think dating all of these languages gives me a different view of programming. Each language has it's own nuiances. They each have their own communities and eco-systems.  

These things make me think. Sometimes they make me think hard. That's when things REALLY get interesting.  

In college, I had a professor who made us speak our math. It was a linear algebra course. He didn't let us get by just solving the equations and moving on to the next problem. He wanted more from us. He had us talk about Kernels, Eigenvectors, Linear Transformations, Dot-Products, and so on - things which had abstract symbols that we could manipulate on paper but didn't quite grok at times. He required that each of us articulate what we were doing in plain ol' English. It was hard. He made us think more deeply than others' had asked us to about what we were doing. I enjoyed that.  

He was an interesting professor. I remember him telling us how important communication was. If my memory is right, he was Hungarian and in addition to speaking Hungarian fluently, had a strong grasp of several other languages as well.  

Some of his philosphy and teachings heavily influenced my views on communication: If I didn't have the word for a feeling or a thought, I would stuggle to communicate it to others - and even to understand it myself. My feedback loops would have impedements based on these limitations. 

I see this with my children. Their vocabulary is growing, but sometimes they become frustrated when they can't communicate their wants or how they're feeling (they're 4 and 1). I still feel this sometimes when I'm unsure how to communicate what I'm thinking or feeling and have to slow down, collect my thoughts, maybe draw things out, or find some mechanism to sort it all out and make sense of it.

The more I learn how to communicate what I'm learning, the easier it becomes to learn more (that was a lot of "learns" :) ) When I know how to express an idea or concept, I can communicate this to others, build off of it, and grow. 

When I first learned how to program, I was just hacking away trying to get the computer to do things. I wasn't focused on communication and soon learned how much that would bite me later on down the road. When I'd come back to programs I'd written, or try to build off of programs others had written, I would struggle. Code really IS read more often than it's written. I started to pay more attention to that - a lot more attention.

I read clean code, I embraced craftsmanship, TDD, BDD, and ATDD. These things helped, and continue to help me.

In this journey I paired with some folks and learned a little Ruby. This was the first language to really change the way I think. I thought I "got" OOP. Then [Ruby](http://poignant.guide/) came along. Boy was I wrong. Ruby taught me more about OOP in a few short hours than I'd ever learned in years of programming in other languages. 

I've applied some of what I've learned from Ruby and other languages to other styles of development independent of the language. That's the joy of being a polyglot :)

So... Elixir
One of the people who I follow in the development communities is Dave Thomas. He and Andy Hunt wrote the [Pick-Axe book](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby) a while back. He's been a key figure in the Ruby community for quite some time.

I watched him begin talking a bit about Elixir not too long ago, saw he'd written a book about it, and saw he was becoming more and more active in the Elixir community. I became curious and decided to check it out.

I've continued to stay curious. He'd given a few talks and explained that Elixir definitely [challenged and changed the way he thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hDVftaPQwY). I've found that it's done the same for me and I hope it does for you. If you'd like to share your "why", [I encourage you to do so](https://github.com/xDD-CLE/test-driven-elixir/blob/master/whys/.gitignore) - I'm curious :)

And so, the journey continues...
